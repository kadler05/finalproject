        As COVID-19, a strain of the coronavirus, has spread around the globe in recent months, tournaments, games and other sporting events have been canceled, while others have been modified. The most recent big news? The European track and field championships have been canceled.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, says the only way professional sports will happen this summer is to do so without fans in attendance and by keeping players in hotels.</p>

        The NCAA Division I Council has voted to grant an extra year of eligibility to all student-athletes in spring sports whose seasons were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The NCAA called off its men's and women's basketball tournaments as part of a complete cancellation of all remaining spring and winter championships. Major League Baseball and its players are increasingly focused on a plan that could allow them to start the season as early as May.

But MLB has canceled its London Series in June between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Wimbledon was canceled for the first time since World War II because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Tokyo Olympics have been officially postponed until 2021. Tokyo organizers said the opening ceremony will take place on July 23, 2021 -- after they had been scheduled for this July 24.
