    <p>The FHSU softball team is a NCAA D2 team competing in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association. This years squad consisted of 19 female athletes from all over the country including: California, Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Utah. In the 2019-2020 season, the Lady Tigers finished their short season with a record of 15-13 overall and 2-4 in conference play. The team was comprised of 7 seniors, 8 juniors, 3 sophomores, and 2 freshman.</p>
    <p>On Thursday (March 12, 2020), NCAA President Mark Emmert and the Board of Governors canceled all NCAA Winter and Spring Championships. This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities. Along with the cancellation of NCAA Winter and Spring Championships, the MIAA and its member institutions announced the suspension of all MIAA intercollegiate sports activities (practice and competition) effective at 11 pm, March 12, 2020. The Association's decision is the result of ongoing consultation with campus leaders, and follows the decision today by the NCAA to cancel all winter and spring championships for all three NCAA divisions. The indefinite suspension applies to all institutional practices and competitions in any MIAA sport, regardless of season, until further notice. All spring sports are suspended indefinitely at this time.</p>
